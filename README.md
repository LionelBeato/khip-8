# Khip-8: A Chip-8 Emulator/Interpreter in Kotlin

Khip-8 is a simple Chip-8 emulator/interpreter written in Kotlin. 

## Goals

---
- Get more experience working with Kotlin
- Build out a simple emulator (or emulator-like program in this case) to get more experience with emulation

## FAQ

-----
- *Is this program an emulator or an interpreter?*

    Strictly speaking, all Chip-8 implementations like Khip-8 are interpreters. 
    Chip-8 was originally designed as a language developers could use to write programs quickly and easily.
    You can think of a Chip-8 implementation as a virtual machine that "interprets" the Chip-8 "language."
